      <p><strong>“How can you help me with my startup’s unique situation?”</strong></p>
      <p>It’s a question I’ve been asked by many founders, each in their own way.</p>
      <p>Like many executive roles, the definition of a CTO changes from one business to another. When I think of a CTO, I think of the person who is accountable for everything that happens on the technology side of an organization. They are responsible for deciding what to build, how to build it, and how to manage it once it is live.</p>
      <p>Let’s dive into what each type of CTO looks like, and how I can step into each of those roles for you.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>The Nimble Startup CTO</h2>
          <p><strong>Team size:</strong> Small team of just a few</p>
          <p><strong>CTO focus:</strong> 80% hands-on coding and MVP building, 20% strategy</p>
          <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Rolling up sleeves, making fast technical tradeoffs, and turning vision into product.</p>
          <p>At this stage, the CTO lives in the technical trenches. Speed matters most. The faster you get something workable into your audience's hands, the faster you get feedback. The faster you get feedback, the faster you can adjust, pivot, or remove what doesn't work.</p>
          <p>The goal here is to build your vision as quickly as possible while making smart, real-time decisions under pressure. That's often the hardest part of this phase.</p>
          <p><strong>How I can help:</strong> I've been helping lean startups and founders since the 1990s, translating ideas into functioning websites and applications. I've worked across many tech stacks, adapting as trends evolved. If I don't already know a particular language or framework, I can ramp up quickly and start contributing right away. My strength is bridging your vision with what can be built today.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>The Hybrid Manager CTO</h2>
          <p><strong>Team size:</strong> Medium-sized engineering team with specialized roles</p>
          <p><strong>CTO focus:</strong> 70% team leadership and planning, 20% strategy, 10% coding</p>
          <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Managing architecture and security, guiding teams, and ensuring projects move forward efficiently.</p>
          <p>This CTO leads a team rather than just a project. The role shifts from direct coding to building systems, workflows, and accountability. They're still close enough to the codebase to dive in when needed but spend most of their time ensuring the team executes well.</p>
          <p><strong>How I can help:</strong> I've stepped into existing dev teams and helped reorganize their task flow, mentor junior engineers, and improve team efficiency. I've assessed bandwidth, hired new developers, and resolved coding bottlenecks when timelines were tight. I've also translated executive and sales plans into clear technical roadmaps and deliverables.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>The Managers' CTO</h2>
          <p><strong>Team size:</strong> Large teams, often with multiple departments or outsourced groups</p>
          <p><strong>CTO focus:</strong> 60% understanding managers' needs and advising them, 40% strategy</p>
          <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Acting as a bridge between departments, aligning priorities, and resolving technical or organizational conflicts.</p>
          <p>At this stage, the CTO focuses on managing managers rather than individual contributors. They translate complex technical realities into business terms that leadership can act on, and they keep communication flowing across teams.</p>
          <p><strong>How I can help:</strong> Founders I've worked with often say I absorb complex situations, filter out the noise, and identify clear next steps. Many management bottlenecks come from misalignment between departments. I sit in those meetings, from sales to operations, to help managers understand what needs to happen and how to move their teams in sync. I've been doing this since I was 19, and it's still one of my favorite challenges.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>The C‑Suite CTO</h2>
          <p><strong>Team size:</strong> Large organizations to Fortune 500</p>
          <p><strong>CTO focus:</strong> 100% strategy, finance, partnerships, and company-wide technology vision</p>
          <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Representing technology in the boardroom and guiding long-term technical direction.</p>
          <p>This CTO works at the strategic level. They shape five-year technology plans, manage cross-department initiatives, and make sure technology goals align with business goals. They also serve as truth tellers in the boardroom, grounding ambitions in what is realistic.</p>
          <p><strong>How I can help:</strong> I advise founders in person and over Zoom, reviewing strategies, technical roadmaps, and financial outlooks with an experienced eye. After more than 25 years in technology, I provide candid, data-driven feedback that helps founders see both risks and opportunities. As a former founder, I know how to balance technical ambition with practical execution.</p>
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <div class="callout">
        <p>These CTO types often overlap. A good CTO evolves through them and draws from each as needed. When someone asks me what a CTO is, I like to say:</p>
        <p><strong>“A technical, battle-hardened problem solver who has seen so many scenarios that very little surprises them: a Swiss Army Knife of Tech Solutions.”</strong></p>
      </div>
      <p>That’s how I see myself, and how I aim to operate for every company I work with.</p>
