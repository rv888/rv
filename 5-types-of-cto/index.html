    <h1>The 5 Types of a CTO</h1>
    <p>And how I can fit into each role for your company</p>

      <p><strong>“How can you help me with my startup’s unique situation?”</strong></p>
      <p>It’s a question I’ve been asked by many founders, each in their own way.</p>
      <p>So what exactly does a CTO do? What I've found is that this title is extremely broad and its definition can change from one business to another. At a high level, a CTO should be the person who is accountable for everything that happens on the technology side of an organization. They are responsible for deciding what to build, how to build it, and how to manage it once it is live.</p>
      <p>Let’s dive into what each type of CTO looks like and how I can step into each of those roles for you.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h2>The Nimble Startup CTO</h2>
          <!-- <p><strong>Team size:</strong> Small team of just a few</p> -->
          <p><strong>CTO focus:</strong> 80% hands-on coding and MVP building, 20% strategy</p>
          <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Rolling up sleeves, making fast technical tradeoffs, and turning vision into product.</p>
          <p>At this stage, the CTO lives in the technical trenches. Speed matters most. The goal here is to build your vision as quickly as possible while making smart, real-time decisions under pressure.</p>
          <p><strong>How I can help:</strong> I've been helping lean startups and founders since the 1990s, translating ideas into functioning websites and applications. I've worked across many tech stacks, adapting as trends evolved. If I don't already know a particular language or framework, I can ramp up quickly and start contributing right away. My strength is bridging your vision with what can be built today.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>The Hybrid Manager CTO</h2>
          <!-- <p><strong>Team size:</strong> Medium-sized engineering team with specialized roles</p> -->
          <p><strong>CTO focus:</strong> 70% team leadership and planning, 20% strategy, 10% coding</p>
          <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Managing the system, guiding teams, and ensuring projects move forward efficiently.</p>
          <p>This CTO leads a team rather than just a project. The role shifts from direct coding to building systems, workflows, and accountability. They're still close enough to the codebase to dive in when needed but spend most of their time ensuring the team executes well.</p>
          <p><strong>How I can help:</strong> I've stepped into existing dev teams and helped reorganize their task flow, mentor junior engineers, and improve team efficiency. I've assessed bandwidth, hired new developers, and resolved coding bottlenecks when timelines were tight. I've also translated executive and sales plans into clear technical roadmaps and deliverables.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>The Managers' CTO</h2>
         <!-- <p><strong>Team size:</strong> Large teams, often with multiple departments or outsourced groups</p> -->
          <p><strong>CTO focus:</strong> 60% understanding managers' needs and advising them, 40% strategy</p>
          <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Acting as a bridge between departments, aligning priorities, and resolving technical or organizational conflicts.</p>
          <p>At this stage, the CTO focuses on handling managers rather than individual contributors. They translate complex technical realities into business terms that leadership can act on, and they keep communication flowing across teams.</p>
          <p><strong>How I can help:</strong> Founders I've worked with often say I am great at absorbing complex situations, filtering out the noise, and identifying clear next steps. Many management bottlenecks come from misalignment between departments. I sit in those meetings, from sales to operations, to help managers understand what needs to happen and how to move their teams in sync. I've been doing this since I was 19, and it's still one of my favorite challenges.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h2>The C‑Suite CTO</h2>
          <!-- <p><strong>Team size:</strong> Large organizations to Fortune 500</p> -->
          <p><strong>CTO focus:</strong> 100% strategy, finance, partnerships, and company-wide technology vision</p>
          <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Representing technology in the boardroom and guiding long-term technical direction.</p>
          <p>This CTO works at the strategic level. They shape five-year technology plans, manage cross-department initiatives, and make sure technology goals align with business goals. They also serve as truth tellers in the boardroom, grounding ambitions in what is realistic.</p>
          <p><strong>How I can help:</strong> I advise founders in person and over Zoom, reviewing strategies, technical roadmaps, and financial outlooks with an experienced eye. After more than 25 years in technology, I provide candid, data-driven feedback that helps founders see both risks and opportunities. As a former founder, I know how to balance technical ambition with practical execution.</p>
        </li>
          <li>
              <h2>The Visionary Integrator CTO</h2>
             <!-- <p><strong>Team size:</strong> Variable, often cross-functional and spread across in-house, AI, and vendor ecosystems</p> -->
              <p><strong>CTO focus:</strong> 50% strategic foresight and innovation scouting, 50% system integration and automation enablement</p>
              <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> This CTO focuses on how technology, automation, and AI can connect across departments, vendors, and customer experiences. Their mission is to translate a company’s overall goals into a fully connected digital ecosystem where systems, APIs, and data all communicate effectively.</p>
              <p>Unlike the C-Suite CTO who primarily advises at the board level, the Visionary Integrator CTO works within the organization to bring emerging technologies to life. They evaluate new tools, pilot AI copilots internally, experiment with automation workflows, and develop real-world strategies for scaling technology across the company.</p>
              <p><strong>How I can help:</strong> I have spent much of the past few years in this role, connecting cloud platforms, AI models, streaming infrastructures, and automation tools into unified and functioning systems. Whether integrating OpenAI-based assistants into production, merging Ant Media streams with backend analytics, or automating workflows across remote teams, this hybrid space of “innovation operations” is where I thrive.</p>
          </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <div class="callout">
        <p>These CTO types often overlap. A good CTO is a blend of them and draws from each as needed. When someone asks me what a CTO is, I like to say:</p>
        <p><strong>“A technical, battle-hardened problem solver who has seen so many scenarios that very little surprises them: a Swiss Army Knife of Tech Solutions.”</strong></p>
      </div>
      <p>That’s how I see myself, and how I aim to operate for every company I work with.</p>
